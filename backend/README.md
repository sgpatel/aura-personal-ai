Here's a basic `README.md` file based on the information you've provided about your **Aura AI Assistant Backend** project. It includes sections for installation, setup, features, and API documentation.

# Aura AI Assistant Backend

This is the backend service for the **Aura AI Assistant** project. It provides a RESTful API built with **FastAPI** to handle user authentication, data storage (notes, reminders, logs), processing user commands via NLU (placeholder), and generating summaries (placeholder).

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JWT tokens.
- **Data Management:** CRUD operations for various user data types:
  - Notes (Global & Date-Associated)
  - Reminders (DB storage, scheduling placeholder)
  - Spending Logs
  - Investment Notes
  - Medical Logs
- **Command Processing:** Endpoint (`/process`) to receive user input, simulate NLU (Natural Language Understanding), and trigger corresponding actions.
- **Summarization:** 
  - Daily Summary endpoint (AI Placeholder)
  - Note Summary by Tag/Keyword endpoint (AI Placeholder)
- **Modular Structure:** Organized codebase for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Database Integration:** Uses **SQLAlchemy ORM** with **PostgreSQL**.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication:** JWT (python-jose, PyJWT), Passlib (for password hashing)
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic
- **Configuration:** python-dotenv
- **Migrations (Recommended):** Alembic
- **Language:** Python 3.8+

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8** or higher
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **PostgreSQL** Server (running locally or accessible)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

If you have a repository for the project, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd aura-project/backend
```

If you don't have a repo, simply navigate to your backend directory.

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Application

The application uses a `.env` file for configuration. Create the `.env` file by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit `.env` with the following values:

- **DATABASE_URL:** Update this with your actual PostgreSQL connection string.
  
  Example format: 
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://aura_user:supersecret@localhost:5432/aura_db
  ```

- **SECRET_KEY:** Generate a strong secret key (e.g., using `python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'`) and paste it here. This is crucial for security.
  
- **LOG_LEVEL (Optional):** Set the logging level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG).

### 5. Database Setup

Ensure **PostgreSQL** is running and accessible.

1. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE aura_db;
   ```
2. Create the user and grant privileges (if needed).

### 6. Database Migrations (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to use **Alembic** for managing database schema changes.

1. Initialize Alembic (if not already done):
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

2. Configure `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py` to point to your database URL and models.

   Example `alembic/env.py`:
   ```python
   from backend.db.base_class import Base
   target_metadata = Base.metadata
   ```

3. Create an initial migration:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial models"
   ```

4. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

(Alternatively, for quick local development, you can uncomment the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line in `main.py`'s startup event. However, this is not suitable for production environments.)

## Running the Server

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd aura-project
   ```
3. Run the Uvicorn server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

You can also access the interactive API documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## API Structure

The main API is versioned under `/api/v1`. Endpoints are grouped by resource type under `/api/v1/`:

- **/auth**: Token generation, user registration, and login.
  - POST /auth/register: User registration
  - POST /auth/login: Login and JWT token generation

- **/users**: User information and management.
  - GET /users/me: Get the current user information
  - PUT /users/me: Update current user information

- **/process**: Main endpoint for processing text commands (NLU).
  - POST /process: Receive and process user commands, trigger actions

- **/notes**: CRUD operations for notes, including summaries.
  - GET /notes: Get all notes
  - POST /notes: Create a new note
  - PUT /notes/{note_id}: Update a note
  - DELETE /notes/{note_id}: Delete a note
  - GET /notes/summary: Get a summary of notes by tag/keyword

- **/investments**: CRUD operations for investment notes.
  - GET /investments: Get all investment notes
  - POST /investments: Create a new investment note
  - PUT /investments/{investment_id}: Update an investment note
  - DELETE /investments/{investment_id}: Delete an investment note

- **/medical**: CRUD operations for medical logs.

  - POST /medical: Create a new medical log
  - PUT /medical/{medical_id}: Update a medical log
  - DELETE /medical/{medical_id}: Delete a medical log

## Running Tests (Placeholder)

Tests should be placed in the `backend/tests/` directory. Use a testing framework like **pytest**.

Run tests using:
```bash
pytest backend/tests
```

(Note: Test files have not been generated yet.)
